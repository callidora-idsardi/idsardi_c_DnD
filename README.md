# Drag and Drop Reference

Fixing bugs in a Puzzle Drag and Drop game. 

Problem One:

You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone - this shouldnâ€™t happen. There should only be one piece in one drop zone at a time.

Problem Two: 

The second bug is the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a new puzzle. Those should be removed / reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the player has a fresh board to drop onto.
